Hey there! I am Shreyansh. I am a student currently pursuing bachelors
degree of technology in computer science. I'd like to describe myself as
a curious monkey. Ever since I was a kid, I would always break my toys 
to see how things worked "under the hood". Guess I never really grew up, 
only the toys changed. :)

I like doing a lot of things apart from programming and cybersecurity
stuff. I play piano and sing along sometimes. I like powerlifting and
weightlifting, in fact I might compete sometime in the future. I have
tried my hands at photography, a bit of street magic, playing ukelele
and a bunch of other stuff. I love listening to music, mostly something
mellow, and playing games. I prefer games with an engaging story line,
currently hooked on DOS2 and stardew valley.
