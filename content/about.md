Hi there!
I'm Shreyansh, glad to have you on board. I am a college student
pursuing bachelors of technology in computer science. I'd like to
describe myself as curious. I like to know how things work under the
hood. I find that contributing to open source projects really helps
me with that. I am a contributor to various open source organisations.
You can checkout my github profile for more info! My username, as you
might have guessed is BK1603.

I like doing a lot of things apart from programming and tech related
stuff. I play piano and sing along sometimes. I like powerlifting and
weightlifting, in fact I might compete sometime in the future. I have
tried my hands at photography, a bit of street magic, playing ukelele
and a bunch of other stuff. I love listening to music, mostly something
mellow, and playing games. I prefer games with an engaging story line,
currently hooked on DOS2 and stardew valley.
