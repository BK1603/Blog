As they say, a goal without a plan is just a wish, so here it is, a simple plan:

### The Plan

- [ ] Neovim:
    - [X] Rebase on top of master.
    - [ ] Get libuv_autoread with basics merged.
    - [ ] Get the logging PR merged if it is still required.
    - [ ] Ask around about asynchronous writes, get it closed if it isn't required.

- [ ] QEMU:
    - [ ] Cleanup the patchset
    - [ ] Get virtio-snd with basics merged into master.
    - [ ] Add more features step by step. (Will elaborate this once I start working on QEMU again.)

- [ ] Kernel:
    - [ ] Setup my dev environment again.
    - [ ] Build the latest stable master.
    - [ ] Replicate syzbot issues in QEMU.
    - [ ] Debug using QEMU and gdb.
    - [ ] Fix a syzbot issue and send patch.
