The linux kernel bug fixing program for me was an opportunity to make my dream
of contributing to the linux kernel come true. I have always been curious about
how the Operating System actually works and getting to work on the kernel was
a very fulfiling experience.

I got to work on bugs related to various kernel subsystems like filesystems, net,
crypto and memory management. I learned a lot about a lot of things about all of
these subsystems.

Throughout my mentorship program I fixed five bugs, and I am working on the
sixth one right now. Three of the patches that I sent were accepted into the kernel,
whereas the rest have been acknowledged and reviewed by other contributors
and are waiting to be merged.

I got to experience working with the linux kernel community first hand, and I would
like to continue contributing to the linux kernel as a hobby, and if things go my way,
I would like to work on the kernel as my day job.

I would like to thank my mentor Shuah Khan for helping me with my doubts at various
occassions throughout the mentorship program, and to the rest of the kernel community
for helping me with my queries and reviewing the patches that I sent. Also, I would
like to thank them for giving me this absolutely amazing opportunity. I hope I can be
a long term contributor to the linux kernel, and I get to work on even bigger projects
in the kernel.
