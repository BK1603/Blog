It has been a while since I last posted here. I think it is a good time to give out some updates.

### What's new?

- I am no more a college student. I finished my college a couple of months ago,
  and now I have a job as a software engineer.
- It was hard continuing open source development for almost the entirety of this
  year so far. I got an internship and as per our college policy I had to give it my
  best to get hired as a full time employee in the said company. Even after I did
  land the job, settling in took a lot of my time and energy. All of which meant
  no more interesting projects. :(
- There is a new section called "The Plan". Upon reading this post further you will
  find out that I am trying to get back to open source development again. The new
  section holds a kind of a roadmap to that goal. 

### Where is this going?

Considering the fact that now I have been able to settle in a bit, I am trying to pick
up where I left things off. Hopefully I will be able to finish them all off before getting
stuck with something else again.

As for this blog, since there are not a lot of readers for this I will start using this
more like a tech journal sort of thing. And this will still be about how do things work.

### Open source stuff

I remember wanting to become a maintainer for various open source repositories, and although
I think it is a bit too late for me to start now, (considering how I wanted to be the college
student who maintains his fav open source tools,) I guess I still want to do it. But honestly,
it doesn't sound as exciting now, since I already am a software developer and not that
cool college student. Takes some of the excitement/charm out of it. Almost feels as if I missed
a chance at something.

The motivation for this comes mostly from my office. It is thanks to people there that I can see
that not only is it possible, but it also is necessary to have a hobby, that you can pursue after
work is done.

### What to expect from this blog?

Well, just like I said, for the most part this will be a sort of a tech journal. I still like learning
about things and what makes them tick and this blog will still have posts that tell you exactly
that. How things work under the hood, any interesting problems/solutions/ideas that I come accross
while working on things, etc. will all be documented here for me to occasionaly glance back at. And
hopefully someday I write something here that will be more than just for me, something that will
help others with their projects, problems, or maybe their lives. 

### Upcoming post

I just started out with neovim development again. So I will be talking about neovim, what's changed in
the code, why did it change, how does the change effect my PR, and what is the progress on libuv_autoread.

Just as a reminder to myself, I want to open a new PR, with all the good to haves stripped off so that
we can get something basic into neovim as quickly as possible.

A few discussions:
- Do we want a new option? (yes: what?, no: Change runtime directly, mention in docs.)
- Does changing the behavior of autoread like this affect other plugins? (What do we do about it?)
