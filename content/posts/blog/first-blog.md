## What is this blog for?
I'll use this blog for writing about my adventures in open source. The 
issues that I fixed and how I fixed them. I might also write about how
various open source softwares work "under the hood". You know the good 
stuff ;)

I'll try and write about any security vulnerabilities that I might find
in open source softwares. Although this is a long shot, but well, 
if I do find something, I might as well write about how I found it.

Other than that I will write about any interesting stuff that I come across.
Though most of it would be just how things work. Like how are files
represented in memory, or how does virtual memory work. How does
various network protocols work and so on and so forth. You get the idea
right?

I hope this makes up for an interesting blog, and that it helps every one
who loves knowing about stuff like I do. :)

Also most of this blog would be divided in various "categories" using tags.
You can find them at the end of each post. Hope you enjoy your stay here!
